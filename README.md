SoundBoardPlusPlus
==================

A customizable soundboard in which the user can add their own sounds, either from a file on their phone, or by recording a sound in the moment.

Written using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), a tool that allows JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to be compiled to native apps.

SoundBoardPlusPlus is still in pre-alpha, and many things aren't working at all. Stay tuned for updates!
